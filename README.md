# middleware-service-sdk

Middleware service for which expose rest api

### Installation

This module is a part of middleware services. You can install it in 2 ways:

1) through core middleware installer  [middleware installer](https://www.npmjs.com/package/chronobank-middleware)
2) by hands: just clone the repo, do 'npm install', set your .env - and you are ready to go

#### About

This module works on the basis of Node-Red. As is known, Node-red is  a programming tool for wiring together hardware devices, APIs and online services. Middleware-service-sdk extends the standard sets of components of Node-red such as.

#### New components

| type of node | name of node | description |
| ------------ | ------------ | ----------- |
| input        | amqp         | AMQP input node. Connects to a server and subscribes to the specified exchange or queue
| output       | amqp         | AMQP output node. Connects to a server and delivers the message payload to the specified exchange or queue
| function     | async function| A JavaScript function block to run against the messages being received by th node
| connectors   | mongo        | single mongoose query connector
| utils        | query to mongo | converts query params to mongo like query

#### How it work

This module uses mongoDB as a database. Module creates 3 collections:  migrations, noderedstorage and  nodereduser.
 
Collection 'migrations' keeps id flows which was subjected to migration.
Collection 'noderedstorages' keeps all created flows.
Collection 'noderedusers' keeps information about an admin.

In order to start a service we tentatively need to add an admin`s record to the noderedusers collection. And after that we can start to work.

After deploying your flow it will save in your project, by default it is a folder 'migration'. Also it saves in a database in the noderedstoreges collection.

After service restart, he will upload earlier created flows.

In the event if you need to import your flows in the another database, there is a migration tool in the service-sdk.

#### Example

Let`s make simple API where we can register our new wallet addresses.

Step by step:

1) add 'http end-point' component - it is our request and name it 'create addr'

![create_addr](resource/created_addr.png)

2) add service-sdk - 'amqp in' component to be connected to the rabbitmq queue/exchange, named it 'post addresses'

![amqp_in](resource/amqp_in.png)

3) add 'function' component for the 'amqp in'

![function_amqp_in](resource/function_for_amqp.png)

4) add 'function' component that will allow us to process the request to add new addresses

![request_handler](resource/Request_handler.png)

5) add service-sdk - 'mongo' component that will save our new record in the mongoDB

![mongo](resource/mongo.png)

6) add 'switch' component that will route messages for respond and event in rabbitmq

7) add 'function' component that will forms the answer for responce

![function_for_responce](resource/function_for_responce.png)

8) add 'function' component that will forms event in rabbitmq

![function_for_amqp](resource/function_for_rabbitmq.png)

9) Finally, add the 'http responce' and 'amqp out' components, where 'http responce' send responce and 'amqp out' send event to rabbitmq

10) We can deploy our flow 

##### —Åonfigure your .env

To apply your configuration, create a .env file in root folder of repo (in case it's not present already).
Below is the expamle configuration:

```
MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27017/data
REST_PORT=8081
NODERED_MONGO_URI=mongodb://localhost:27018/data
RABBIT_URI=amqp://localhost:5672

```

The options are presented below:

| name | description|
| ------ | ------ |
| MONGO_URI   | the URI string for mongo connection
| REST_PORT   | rest plugin port
| NODERED_MONGO_URI   | the URI string for mongo collection for keeping node-red users and flows (optional, if omitted - then default MONGO_URI will be used)
| RABBIT_URI  | rabbitmq URI connection string
